# SQL-Project-on-Credit-Card-Transactions-analysis
This project provides an analysis of the credit card transactions made in India using SQL. 

The dataset used for analysis contains insights into a collection of credit card transactions, offering a comprehensive look at the spending habits of Indians across the nation. From the Gender and Card type used to carry out each transaction, to which city saw the highest amount of spending and even what kind of expenses were made, this dataset paints an overall picture of how money is being spent in India today.

The following key insights have been generated from this project:

1) Top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends
 
2) Highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type

3) Transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)

4) City which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type
 
5) Print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)
